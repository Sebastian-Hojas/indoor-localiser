We developed a proof-of-concept mobile Android application called Localiser, which uses Wi-Fi positioning technique at its heart and calculates the devicesâ€™s position in an **indoor location** with an accuracy of at least 5 meters. This application further gives the user details of point of interests near his/her location, such as nearby class rooms. Our app has implemented all native Android accessibility features, which would allow a visually impaired person to still use our app fluently and orient through campus.

The [documentation](https://github.com/Sebastian-Hojas/android-indoor-localisation/blob/master/doc/Readme.pdf) gives insight how the application has been developed, how fingerprints had been collected and used.

## Demonstration

The application has been test on the campus of the University of Helsinki.
